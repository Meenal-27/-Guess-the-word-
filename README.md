This game was created as part of a project I undertook as a young c++ coder. We were asked to develop a game for a class 11 project in my school.

With consistent effort I got to get very good at it and introduced it to my friends at school. When all of us developed a great liking for the game, and the project was announced, I was intrigued if this game could be implemented using an algorithm and thus went on and took this up as my project. The experience was really memorable as not only did I end up learning new concepts to achieve certain functionalities in my code,
